## Setting up a Workspace

LiquidBounce uses Gradle, to make sure that it is installed properly you can
check [Gradle's website](https://gradle.org/install/).

**Note: As of the native GUI migration, Node.js and Python are no longer required**. The project now uses native 
Minecraft/Fabric GUI components instead of the previous Svelte-based web UI.

1. Clone the repository using `git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/CCBlueX/LiquidBounce`.
2. CD into the local repository.
3. Run `./gradlew genSources`.
4. Open the folder as a Gradle project in your preferred IDE.
5. Run the client.

## GUI Architecture

LiquidBounce has been migrated from a web-based UI (Svelte + JCEF) to native Minecraft GUI components for better 
performance and integration:

- **ClickGUI**: Native Kotlin implementation using Minecraft's Screen and widget APIs
- **HUD Editor**: Drag-and-drop HUD element positioning with native rendering
- **Menu Screens**: Native screens for alt management, settings, and other functions
- **Settings Widgets**: Custom widget implementations for boolean, float, and integer settings

The previous Svelte-based theme system in `src-theme/` is deprecated but preserved for reference.

## Additional libraries

### Mixins

Mixins can be used to modify classes at runtime before they are loaded. LiquidBounce uses it to inject its code into the
Minecraft client. This way, none of Mojang's copyrighted code is shipped. If you want to learn more about it, check out
its [Documentation](https://docs.spongepowered.org/5.1.0/en/plugin/internals/mixins.html).

## Contributing

We appreciate contributions. So if you want to support us, feel free to make changes to LiquidBounce's source code and
submit a pull request.
